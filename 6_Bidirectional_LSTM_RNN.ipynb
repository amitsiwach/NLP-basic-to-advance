Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, cashed out nearly $1 million in investments last year, according to their 2015 tax return, which the White House released on Friday. The figure suggests that they were preparing to finance large expenses like a home purchase. Mr. Obama said last month that the family would remain in the Washington area after he left the White House in January 2017, while his younger daughter, Sasha, finishes high school. The tax return, released before the filing deadline on Monday, shows that the Obamas earned $436, 065 last year and paid $81, 472 in total tax  \\u2014   an effective rate of about 18. 7 percent. They are getting a refund of $22, 859. The Obamas sold Treasury notes amounting to $994, 941, according to the return. The White House declined to give an explanation for the sales. But it is clear that the Obamas will face an array of new costs over the next year, including a likely home purchase and the first year of college for Malia, their older daughter. She is said to be considering Stanford and Harvard, where tuition and other costs exceed $66, 000 for the coming academic year. Unlike in previous years, the Obamas opted to take their refund instead of applying it to the next year\\u2019s tax payment. The return also showed: \\u2022 Falling income. The Obamas earned about $40, 000 less than in the previous year, largely the result of a steep decline in royalties from the president\\u2019s two autobiographies, \\u201cDreams From My Father\\u201d and \\u201cThe Audacity of Hope. \\u201d Their primary source of income was Mr. Obama\\u2019s $400, 000 salary, which was unchanged from 2014. But the roughly $60, 000 he earned from sales of the books in 2015 amounts to nearly $35, 000 less than the year before  \\u2014   and a far cry from the $8. 1 million they brought in 2008 and 2009. The family\\u2019s charitable contributions totaled more than what the books generated last year. \\u2022 Giving back. The Obamas donated about 15 percent of their income  \\u2014   $64, 066  \\u2014   to charity. The largest single contribution, about $9, 000, was to Fisher House, a   favorite of the Obamas that provides accommodations to the families of service members who are receiving treatment at military and veterans\\u2019 hospitals.\",\n          \"By Brig Asif H. Raja on November 1, 2016 \\r\\nAsif Haroon Raja \\r\\nThe ISI had developed its long arm capability during the tenures of Gen Akhtar Abdur Rehman, Lt Gen Hamid Gul (VT editor) and Lt Gen Javed Nasir as DG ISI. It was owing to this capability of hitting the chosen target outside the frontiers of Pakistan that the ISI earned the reputation of a dreaded outfit and the best in Asia. The long arm began to shrivel when Benazir Bhutto was PM from 1988 to 1990 and Gen Waheed Kakar was COAS and Lt Gen Javed Ashraf Qazi had replaced Gen Javed Nasir. This change in posture was a result of pressure of the US and the West, pressing Pakistan to refrain from meddling in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) and in India, or else it will be declared a terrorist state. Pressure was mounted at the behest of India which had become strategic partner of USA and Israel in 1991/1992 and darling of the West. \\r\\nAfter the occupation of Afghanistan by 1, 50,000 Soviet forces in December 1979, Pakistan under Gen Ziaul Haq had decided to provide refuge to about 5 million Afghan refugees and to support the Afghan Mujahideen in their resistance. The US came forward with a package of $ 3.5 billion in June 1981 after making a measured assessment that Pakistan had the will and capability to fight the proxy war. The offer was accepted only when it was conveyed that the ISI will coordinate and conduct the entire war without the aid of CIA and that the US and others would restrict their support to provision of funds and weapons/equipment only. As a Frontline State, Pakistan suffered a great deal throughout the Afghan war at the hands of KGB-KHAD-RAW-AlZulfiqar nexus and Afghan armed forces, but achieved the miracle by defeating and pushing out Soviet forces in February 1989. After achieving its objective without employing a single soldier, the US abandoned Pakistan as well as the Mujahideen who had sacrificed 1.5 million people and had helped the US in becoming a sole super power. \\r\\nOnce Pakistan fell from the grace of USA and it was put under sanctions on account of its covert nuclear program suspected to be geared towards making an Islamic bomb, it came under the shadow of black star. Pakistan\\u2019s nuclear program became an eyesore for India, Israel and USA. It faced the whole brunt of fallout effects of ten-year Afghan war that had been fully supported by the US led free world. USSR that had shrunk to Russian Federation was highly bitter, while India was perpetually hostile. Iran was not so friendly owing to its reservations over the developments in Afghanistan. Explosive situation in Afghanistan due to civil war and power tussle among the seven Mujahideen groups impacted the security of Pakistan. \\r\\nStart of armed insurgency in IOK in late 1989 and India pumping in over 700,000 troops into the Valley had its effects on Pakistan\\u2019s security dynamics. In 1990/91, both sides had come close to war. Internally, the society had become militarized due to the Afghan war and sectarianism fomented by Iran and Saudi Arabia had created serious law and order situation in Punjab. PPP and PML-N acrimoniously tussled with each other for power because of which no govt could complete its mandatory 5 years tenure. \\r\\nFragmentation of USSR and demise of communism on account of its military defeat in Afghanistan and increase of influence of Pakistan and India decreasing its influence in Afghanistan had vexed India. It feared that Pakistan may exploit the situation in IOK and liberate it with the help of over 60 Jihadi groups and take its revenge of the humiliation it had suffered in East Pakistan in 1971. It dreaded that Pakistan may replicate its model of supporting the Mukti Bahini. Sensing the gravity of the situation, India started propagating that Pakistan is behind the insurgency in IOK and that the ISI is funding, training and launching terrorists from Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK). It urged the UN and world powers to rein in Pakistan and restrain ISI from conducting cross LoC terrorism. \\r\\nThe US, both Republicans and Democrats, had been constantly wooing India to join its camp since early 1950s, but India preferred the Soviet camp, although it professed to be non-aligned. It was elated when India feeling orphaned after the collapse of USSR fell like a ripe apple into the waiting arms of USA and both became bedfellows in 1991. Once its newfound love sought help from her paramour, the latter stood behind her and sternly cautioned Pakistan to lay its hands off IOK. Change in circumstances compelled Pakistan to restrict its support to the Kashmiris in distress to moral, political and diplomatic levels only. The Kashmir oriented Jihadi groups based in AJK and in Southern Punjab however continued to extend support to the Kashmiris seeking right of self-determination as provided for in the UN resolutions. Indian security forces equipped with draconian laws and license to kill without any fear of accountability or censure by the UN and world powers carried out inhuman torture, employed massive force, and used rape as a weapon to break the will of the freedom fighters. The UN and international community turned a deaf ear to the cries of Kashmiris. \\r\\nDespite the fact that IOK had become the most militarized region of the world (one soldier for 17 civilians), and Kashmiris had suffered over 100,000 fatalities, 10,000 rapes, detention of thousands in secret dens and destruction of their property, the freedom fighters kept the torch of liberty aglow. The heroics of Kashmiris against heavy odds had a telling effect on the morale of Indian Army and paramilitary forces in IOK. Soldiers suffered from demoralization and homesickness; cases of suicides, desertions, killing of seniors and comrades by soldiers, and indiscipline jumped up at an alarming rate. Officers and men dreaded posting to Kashmir, while rate of compassionate cases wanting posting out from Kashmir shot up. A stage came when recruitment in Army dropped to rock bottom levels. The then Indian Army chief had to appear on the TV and run an ad campaign to appeal to the youth to join the Army on better pay scale and perks. Kashmir had become a perforated wound for India and economic cost was becoming unbearable. It was becoming difficult for India to hide its massive human rights violations and barbarities of Indian security forces. \\r\\nHere I may add that the Indian Army had suffered humiliation at Dras-Kargil in 1999 at the hands of handful of Mujahideen and irregulars of Northern Light Infantry. It was eventually bailed out by the US led G-8 by exerting immense pressure on Pakistan to immediately vacate the captured territories. The Indian armed forces went through another embarrassment in 2002 when it had to sheepishly withdraw from its western border after a ten-month standoff during which it had constantly huffed and puffed but couldn\\u2019t pick up courage to cross the border. Aggressive response of Pak armed forces had taken the steam out of their chauvinism. \\r\\nUnfortunately, all that was gained on the Kashmir front and on the military front was wasted away after Gen Musharraf wilted under the US pressure in 2003 and decided to take steps to please USA and India. Reining in Kashmir focused Jihadi groups, allowing India to fence the LoC and signing peace treaty with India in January 2004 changed the perspective. It helped Indian military to suppress Kashmir freedom movement. Earlier on, Musharraf had submitted to all the 7 demands of Washington in September 2001. Free hand given to CIA and FBI had enabled the two to establish their network in FATA and gain control over airports and seaport in Pakistan. Intelligence acquisition in FATA was taken over by CIA and ISI pushed on the back seat. \\r\\nIndo-Pak peace treaty in 2004 enabled RAW to ignite FATA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Baluchistan and Karachi. While RAW assisted by CIA, NDS, MI-6 and Mossad made full use of its long arm to bleed Pakistan with the help of proxies, Pak security forces and ISI remained handicapped. The so-called friends pushed Pakistan to fight terrorism but secretly backed the terrorists. The US kept twisting the arm of Pakistan that if ISI meddled into India or Afghanistan it will be declared a rogue outfit. Perforce, the ISI undertook protective measures only, but its defensive actions were more often breached because the so-called allies stabbed Pakistan in the back. As a consequence, RAW and its strategic partners carried out one-sided covert war while the ISI at best tried to ward off the attacks. In spite of defensive policy of the govt and ISI, and Pakistan suffering much more human casualties than any other country in the war on terror, ISI was blamed to be in collusion with Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). These were termed as strategic assets of military establishment to overcome conventional inferiority against arch enemy India. The lost intelligence space In FATA/KP was gradually recovered when Lt Gen Shuja Pasha took over as DG ISI and Gen Ashfaq Kayani as COAS in 2008. \\r\\nAll the terror attacks that took place in India between 2001 and 2008 were pinned on JeM and LeT and their connection was made with ISI. Since Pakistan made no effort to disprove Indian contention even after it was revealed by Indian investigative agencies and Home Ministry officials that Hindu terror groups and Indian military intelligence officers were involved in the attacks, it became easier for India to further strengthen its narrative of portraying Pakistan as a terror abetting state and a nursery of terrorism. India\\u2019s narrative was boosted up by its strategic allies. The US dubbed Pakistan as the most dangerous county in the world. Pakistan\\u2019s overall defensive policy and apologetic stance emboldened its detractors to keep whipping and bleeding it without fear of tit for tat response from ISI. \\r\\nOther than the salvos fired by the Indo-Afghan-US-Israel nexus on Pak Army and ISI, Pakistan political leadership of major political parties also view the two premier institutions with distrust. Both PPP and PML-N in line with their 2006 Charter of Democracy made efforts to enfeeble ISI and keep Army under their thumb. First attempt was made by Benazir Bhutto when she replaced Lt Gen Hamid Gul with retired Lt Gen Kallue in 1989 and next tasked Air Marshal Zulfiqar to cut ISI to size under the garb of reforms. PM Yusaf Raza Gilani tried to civilianize ISI in August 2008 by placing it under Ministry of Interior. Kerry Lugar Bill in 2009 and Memo scandal in 2011 were other attempts to curtail military\\u2019s power. Nawaz Sharif has a history of locking horns with every Army chief and has still not got out of the hangover of Gen Musharraf. Although he didn\\u2019t clash with Gen Raheel but at times civil-military relations became tense. \\r\\nIt has now been conclusively established that RAW and NDS in unison and backed by other agencies are deeply involved in proxy war in Pakistan since 2003 and have inflicted tens of thousands of cuts on the body of Pakistan and its people. Series of conspiracies have been hatched and launched to destabilize and fragment Pakistan. RAW-NDS nexus backed by CIA is continuing to use Afghanistan as a launching pad for terror attacks in Pakistan. In order to scuttle CPEC, focus of attacks is on Baluchistan and KP. India is keeping the LoC on fire. So far it has violated 2003 ceasefire agreement 178 times and killed 19 civilians and injured 80. \\r\\nThe anti-Pakistan foreign agencies are making full use of TTP, Jamaat Ahrar, Lashkar Jhangvi, BLA, BRA, BLF and MQM as proxies. London is a safe haven for MQM leadership and Baloch rebel leaders, while Afghanistan has provided sanctuaries to TTP runaway leaders in Kunar, Nuristan and Nangarhar. Besides these strategic assets, the detractors are also making use of NGOs, human rights activists and segment of media to make Pakistan a compliant state of India. Since HN, JeM, and LeT are not playing the game of foreign agencies, they are dubbed as terrorist groups and strategic assets of Pak Army/ISI. They want Pakistan to take strict action against them or else face isolation and sanctions. \\r\\nIt was in the backdrop of this concern of US and India that the Dawn News published a story on October 6. The planted story was allegedly furnished by someone from within the PM House where a national security conference presided by the PM and attended by Foreign Secretary, Punjab Chief Minister, COAS, DG ISI and National Security Adviser was held. The invented story written by Cyril Almeida gave an impression of serious rift between civil and military leadership and that while the govt wanted to proceed against the defunct militant groups, the ISI didn\\u2019t. Probable motive of concocted story was to demean the Army/ISI and to reinforce Indo-US stance that Pak Army and ISI were in league with terror groups. The types of Hussain Haqqani, Ayesha Sadiqa, Farzana Bari and several other liberal journalists assembled in London two days ago to play up this story. MQM (Altaf) hosted them. To ascertain the truth, a high powered committee comprising members from three intelligence agencies will carry out inquest. \\r\\nHaving collected tons of evidence, yet Pakistan takes the barbs and whips without a whimper and doesn\\u2019t pick up courage to strike back. The long arm of ISI remains sheathed for reasons best known to the policy makers. It implies our leaders have decided to give a free hand to our enemies to continue bleeding Pakistan without any fear of retaliation or even protest. Going by the well-established concept that \\u2018offence is the best defence\\u2019, until and unless the ISI pay back the RAW and NDS in the same coin, one sided bleeding of Pakistanis will continue. Long arm must be unsheathed. \\r\\nThe writer is retired Brig, war veteran, defence analyst, columnist, author of 5 books, Vice Chairman Thinkers Forum Pakistan, DG Measac Research Centre, and Member Executive Council PESS.

Moments later, he felt dizzy and was carried out on a stretcher, apparently dying from   punctures or perhaps a toxic liquid splashed on his face by two women who ran away. The ruckus caused by the man\\u2019s death on Monday at the international airport for Kuala Lumpur was minor news until a thunderbolt from the South Korean and Malaysian news media a day later: The victim was Kim   45, the estranged older half brother of Kim   the unpredictable and ruthless leader of North Korea. The death immediately turned into an international assassination intrigue connected to the opaque regime of the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea for more than 60 years. It came as Kim   33, who has ordered scores of subordinates executed when he questioned their fealty, has further shaken up the ranks of his closest aides, purging the chief of the secret police less than two weeks ago. In addition, Kim   has stoked a new international crisis with a ballistic missile launching and threats of more nuclear weapons tests. The South Korean news channel TV Chosun said that two women had stabbed Kim   with poisoned needles and fled in a taxi and that the local police were searching for them. The Star, a Malaysian newspaper, quoted the police as saying the victim had sought help from a departure hall receptionist after someone \\u201cgrabbed him from behind and splashed liquid on his face. \\u201d He died as medics rushed him to a hospital. Political experts on North Korea\\u2019s politics immediately speculated that Kim   had ordered the assassination of his older half sibling, who at one time had been the heir apparent and had been favored by China, the country\\u2019s ally and principal benefactor. \\u201cMaybe Kim   was about to do something drastic that would either compromise the regime or the family,\\u201d said Jae H. Ku, director of the U. S.  Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. \\u201cBy the nature of things in North Korea, the fact that he is in the bloodline represented a threat. \\u201d Others were even more emphatic in their suspicion that Kim   had been responsible, partly because Kim   had been publicly critical of the transfer of power that made Kim   the top leader after the death of their father, Kim   in 2011. \\u201cThe apparent murder today of Kim   in Malaysia by agents of his brother is the latest explosive turn in Pyongyang\\u2019s vicious palace intrigue,\\u201d said Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist who specializes in North and South Korea at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. \\u201cThe question remains: Do these deadly measures secure his rule or serve to undermine it?\\u201d There also was speculation that Kim   might have ordered Kim   killed because China might have been planning to support him as a replacement for Kim   who has angered Chinese leaders with his provocative weapons and missile tests. \\u201cKim   reportedly has been Beijing\\u2019s favorite, which may mean one day the Chinese Communist Party may overthrow Kim   and install Kim \\u201d said Lee   a North Korea expert at Tufts University\\u2019s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. The Royal Malaysia Police identified the dead man as Kim Chol, an alias that South Korean officials said had been used by Kim  . A police statement said the cause of death was under investigation. In Seoul on Wednesday, Prime Minister Hwang   who is serving as acting president during the impeachment trial of President Park   called a meeting of   cabinet ministers and urged his government to work closely with the Malaysian authorities to help uncover who killed Kim  . \\u201cIf he was killed by the Kim   regime, it will be an example of its cruelty and inhumaneness,\\u201d Mr. Hwang said. North Korea\\u2019s   media has said nothing about the reports. Kim   the eldest son of Kim   had been widely considered next in line to succeed him until 2001, when he was caught trying to take his son to Tokyo Disneyland with a fake visa. He was detained for several days, then deported to China. Other analysts in South Korea say Kim   fell out of the succession race after his mother, Sung   was rejected by the North Korean leader, who favored Kim  \\u2019s mother, Ko  . Ms. Ko and Kim   had another son, Kim   who was seen at an Eric Clapton concert in London in 2015. North Korea began grooming Kim   as heir after his father  had a stroke in 2008. As his youngest brother consolidated power, Kim   lived in   abroad. Until recently, he was sometimes seen in Macau. TV Chosun said he had also been visiting Singapore and Malaysia, where he had girlfriends. Kim  \\u2019s son, Kim   had once studied in Bosnia and later in France. In an interview with a European television channel in 2012, the son said he did not know how his uncle, Kim   \\u201cbecame a dictator. \\u201d Kim   was once questioned in Macau by a reporter about the likelihood that his half brother would take over, and he seemed to accept his fate. \\u201cIt is my father\\u2019s decision,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo, once he decides, we have to support. \\u201d But at other times, he was critical of Kim  \\u2019s ascendance. \\u201cI believe that my father originally was against the notion of a third generation succeeding him,\\u201d Kim   interviewed in November 2010, told the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi in the book \\u201cMy Father, Kim   and I. \\u201d \\u201cThere must have been some internal reasons that made him change his mind. \\u201d Kim   also once predicted doom for his half brother\\u2019s rule while talking to reporters from Japan, North Korea\\u2019s sworn enemy. His criticism fueled speculation that China and certain generals in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, might be protecting him in case anything should go wrong with Kim  \\u2019s rule. Mr. Gomi said in an interview on Tuesday that the last time he had contacted Kim   in January 2012, he had said North Korea should follow China\\u2019s economic path. China supported Kim   financially for many years because if Kim   died, North Koreans, indoctrinated to venerate the Kim family, would look to Kim   to step in as leader, according to Kang Chunnu, 51, a distant relative of the Kim family who lives in Britain. \\u201cKim   is a person which China can control and the North Korean people can trust,\\u201d she said by telephone. There seemed little question in South Korea that Kim   was behind his half brother\\u2019s death. A spokesman for South Korea\\u2019s governing Liberty Korea Party, Kim   said the killing was a \\u201cnaked example of Kim  \\u2019s reign of terror. \\u201d Since taking power, Mr. Kim has executed more than 140 senior party and military officials deemed a threat to his authority, often ordering them killed by machine guns and even flamethrowers, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a research group affiliated with the South\\u2019s National Intelligence Service. Thae   who was the North\\u2019s No. 2 diplomat in London until his defection to South Korea last summer, said he had fled partly because of Kim  \\u2019s ruthlessness. In 2015, South Korean officials said that Gen. Hyon   the defense minister, had been executed with an antiaircraft gun in Pyongyang after dozing off during military events and   Mr. Kim\\u2019s orders. In August last year, they said Mr. Kim found fault with a deputy premier\\u2019s \\u201cdisrespectful posture\\u201d during a meeting and had him executed by firing squad. Relatives were not spared. An uncle and the country\\u2019s No. 2 official, Jang   was executed in 2013 on charges of factionalism, corruption and sedition. Defectors from North Korea live in fear of retaliation. In 1997, Lee   a nephew of Kim  \\u2019s mother, was shot and killed in Seoul. South Korean officials suspected that a North Korean agent killed Mr. Lee, who had become a bitter critic of the government in Pyongyang after defecting to Seoul in 1982. Cheong   a longtime researcher on the Kim family, said that the killing of Kim   could have been carried out only on the orders of Kim  . Ken E. Gause, a specialist in leadership studies at the CNA Corporation, a research group in Alexandria, Va. said the assassination also might have been meant as a warning to all North Korean expatriates. \\u201cGiven the recent defections,\\u201d he said, \\u201cKim   felt the need to show that the regime could get to anyone who may be contemplating opposing the regime. \\u201d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0447\\u0442\\u043e\\u0431\\u044b \\u044d\\u0442\\u043e \\u0431\\u044b\\u043b\\u0430 \\u0434\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u0433\\u0430 \\u0441 \\u0434\\u0432\\u0443\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u043d\\u0438\\u043c \\u0434\\u0432\\u0438\\u0436\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435\\u043c.\",\n          \" \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e \\u0437\\u0430\\u043c\\u0435\\u0447\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u044b\\u0439 \\u043f\\u0440\\u0438\\u043c\\u0435\\u0440. \\u0411\\u043e\\u043c\\u0431\\u0430\\u0440\\u0434\\u0438\\u0440\\u043e\\u0432\\u043a\\u0438 \\u0411\\u0435\\u043b\\u0433\\u0440\\u0430\\u0434\\u0430 \\u2013 \\u0432\\u043e\\u0442 \\u044d\\u0442\\u043e \\u0438 \\u0435\\u0441\\u0442\\u044c \\u0438\\u043d\\u0442\\u0435\\u0440\\u0432\\u0435\\u043d\\u0446\\u0438\\u044f \\u0432 \\u043e\\u0431\\u0445\\u043e\\u0434 \\u043d\\u043e\\u0440\\u043c \\u0438 \\u043f\\u0440\\u0430\\u0432\\u0438\\u043b \\u043c\\u0435\\u0436\\u0434\\u0443\\u043d\\u0430\\u0440\\u043e\\u0434\\u043d\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e \\u043f\\u0440\\u0430\\u0432\\u0430. \\u0420\\u0430\\u0437\\u0432\\u0435 \\u0421\\u043e\\u0432\\u0435\\u0442 \\u0411\\u0435\\u0437\\u043e\\u043f\\u0430\\u0441\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438 \\u041e\\u041e\\u041d \\u043f\\u0440\\u0438\\u043d\\u0438\\u043c\\u0430\\u043b \\u0440\\u0435\\u0448\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438\\u0435 \\u043e \\u0432\\u043e\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u0438\\u043d\\u0442\\u0435\\u0440\\u0432\\u0435\\u043d\\u0446\\u0438\\u0438 \\u0432 \\u042e\\u0433\\u043e\\u0441\\u043b\\u0430\\u0432\\u0438\\u0438? \\u041d\\u0435\\u0442. \\u0421\\u043e\\u0435\\u0434\\u0438\\u043d\\u0451\\u043d\\u043d\\u044b\\u0435 \\u0428\\u0442\\u0430\\u0442\\u044b \\u0441\\u0434\\u0435\\u043b\\u0430\\u043b\\u0438 \\u044d\\u0442\\u043e \\u0432 \\u043e\\u0434\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u043d\\u0435\\u043c \\u043f\\u043e\\u0440\\u044f\\u0434\\u043a\\u0435.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It technically changes nothing, as Mr. Corbyn has refused to step down, though it underscores his loss of authority among colleagues in Parliament. \\u201cI was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60 percent of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning,\\u201d Mr. Corbyn said after the vote by Labour members of Parliament. \\u201cToday\\u2019s vote by M. P. s has no constitutional legitimacy. \\u201d He added: \\u201cWe are a democratic party with a clear constitution. Our people need Labour Party members, trade unionists and M. P. s to unite behind my leadership at a critical time for our country. \\u201d In the aftermath of Britain\\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, Mr. Corbyn has been hit by the mass resignation of most of his leadership team. About   of Parliament members opposed leaving the union, including the overwhelming majority of Labour members and a smaller majority of members from the governing Conservative Party. Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Friday, the day after the referendum, that he would resign, and a power struggle has begun within the Conservative Party over who will succeed him. Given the disarray in British politics, many Labour lawmakers are worried that a general election may be held soon, and they fear that, with Mr. Corbyn at the party\\u2019s helm, they will face even bigger losses than they did in the May 2015 election. A   Mr. Corbyn was elected last year by an overwhelming majority of party members and supporters, but his support was very shallow among lawmakers. Discontent at Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s performance was crystallized by his campaign in the referendum on European Union membership, in which the party\\u2019s policy was to remain within the bloc. While Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong euroskeptic, did urge Labour supporters to vote to remain, critics regarded his campaign as lackluster, and his message as lukewarm. Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s staunch ally John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer and the party\\u2019s top spokesman on economic issues, has said that Mr. Corbyn is \\u201cnot going anywhere,\\u201d and even vowed to run Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s campaign if there were a new election among Labour Party members. Supporters of Mr. Corbyn have called on his critics to either shut up or challenge him in a formal leadership contest. Under the Labour Party system, the final choice lies with party members and supporters, and Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s allies, who include influential   activists, are confident that he would win   despite some indications that support for him is weakening.\",\n          \"Celebrities trashed President Donald Trump on social media Tuesday after his Education and Justice Departments announced that they would no longer instruct schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms according to their preferred gender identities.

Advances by Syrian government forces and their allies have squeezed the fighters and civilians remaining in   parts of the city into a sliver of territory, spokesmen for the government and the opposition forces said on Monday. The last civilians caught in the shrinking antigovernment enclave issued panicked calls for help. Late Monday, several residents reported via text and voice messages that they were crowded into abandoned apartments and rainy streets, exposed to shelling and afraid they would be killed or arrested if   forces reached them, as antigovernment activists circulated reports of scores of summary killings in retaken areas. The United Nations secretary general, Ban   said in a statement on Monday that he was alarmed by reports of atrocities against a large number of civilians, including women and children. It appeared increasingly likely that the government would gain control of the whole of Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, within days, if not hours. Videos from   districts showed people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and honking horns. That would be a turning point in the civil war, cementing government control over all of Syria\\u2019s most important cities and forcing the opposition and its backers to reckon with whether their movement, especially the armed rebellion, has failed. It also raises questions about how an increasingly confident President Bashar   will govern a deeply wounded and divided country where war still rages. Mr. Assad\\u2019s recent military successes have depended heavily on help from Russia, Iran and the   Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, which are reviled by many of Mr. Assad\\u2019s Sunni opponents, and viewed with unease even by some of his supporters because of their growing power in the country. Large areas of Aleppo and other cities and towns have been reduced to rubble by the fighting. And rebel forces, Kurdish militias and Islamic State fighters are still operating in large areas of northern and eastern Syria. That has been vividly clear in recent days, with Islamic State fighters advancing in the desert city of Palmyra, amid its ancient ruins, as the government focused on Aleppo. For civilians trapped behind the battle lines in Aleppo, though, more urgent questions loomed. Time appeared to be running out to strike a deal to allow them to evacuate. Rebel and opposition leaders want evacuees to be given an option to go to territory they control. Many of the remaining civilians refuse to go to   territory because they are afraid they would be jailed and tortured there. Others say the bombardment in their districts is too intense to allow any escape. There were also reports in state news media of rebel shelling of   areas. According to the Russian government, Mr. Assad\\u2019s main foreign backer, more than 100, 000 people have fled from the rebel enclave to   areas, and 2, 200 rebel fighters have surrendered. At least 13, 000 people have fled in the past 24 hours, it said. But there are still believed to be thousands of civilians trapped in districts that have been bombarded for more than 24 hours, while the army and its militia allies seized most of the southern part of the city. \\u201cAn important call in the name of civilians to help them,\\u201d Abdelkafi   a teacher and antigovernment activist, said in a text message to a group of journalists. \\u201cStop bombing. Take them out. \\u201d The situation was so desperate, residents said, that it was unclear whether rebels and civilians there could even hold a meeting to decide whether to surrender and evacuate. \\u201cBelieve me, no one rejects the safety evacuation,\\u201d one resident, Yasser Abu   said in a text message to the journalists\\u2019 group. \\u201cAll of us are waiting, dying now in the last neighborhoods. \\u201d Hisham   is a civilian member of the local council that had tried to govern the   areas of Aleppo, which once included half the city. Mr. Skeif expressed frustration that while international officials were in contact with rebel leaders, no one appeared to be talking directly to the trapped civilians. \\u201cAll the political activists and the media, the relief workers, the unarmed, we are about 1, 000, including our families,\\u201d he said. Though the government has said it would offer amnesty to anyone who surrenders, \\u201cif the regime entered, we will be slaughtered,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOf course everybody is negotiating with those who are armed, but we are not armed. \\u201d \\u201cThe armed can defend themselves, but we can\\u2019t,\\u201d he added. Mr. Hamdo said in a series of text messages that families in Aleppo were \\u201cwaiting death together. \\u201d \\u201cPeople are running, don\\u2019t know where,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cPeople are under the rubble alive, and no one can save them. Some people are injured in the streets, and no one can go to help them cuz the bombs are always on the same place. \\u201d Some rebel leaders have said that the United States, which backs some rebel groups, sent them a proposal that would allow evacuees their choice of destination, under security guarantees from Russia. But trust has eroded, and no agreement had emerged by Monday night. Syrian and Russian officials say the offensive in Aleppo will continue until rebels surrender or die. \\u201cThe issue of withdrawing militants is the subject of separate agreements,\\u201d Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, told the Ria news agency on Monday. \\u201cThis agreement has not yet been reached, largely because the United States insists on unacceptable terms. \\u201d The sticking point for months has been a dispute between Russia and the United States over what to do about fighters linked with Al Qaeda who are among the rebel groups in eastern Aleppo. The United Nations estimates that about 10 percent of the 8, 000 rebel fighters in the city belong to a   group, the Levant Conquest Front. The rebels and their international backers say the figure is much lower the government says it is much higher. Before the government broke through the rebel defenses, the United Nations was proposing that the Levant Conquest Front leave Aleppo in exchange for three main broad concessions from the government side: an end to bombardment protection and aid for remaining civilians and some form of local administration for rebel areas. But the government rejected any form of   saying that it would \\u201creward terrorists,\\u201d while the rebels rejected versions of the deal that did not include it. Now, there is no meaningful rebel territory left for the local opposition council to govern. \\u201cWe are hearing terrifying S O S calls from the civilians, but we can\\u2019t do anything,\\u201d said Bassem   a spokesman for Nour     one of the main rebel groups in Aleppo. \\u201cThe fighters are defending, but they are retreating under pressure. Unfortunately, the situation is very bad. \\u201d The focus has now shifted to ending the bombardment and protecting the remaining civilians from reprisals, a reasonable fear in a country where, throughout the   conflict, people have been tortured and killed in prison for opposing the government. \\u201cUnderstand this,\\u201d Mr. Hamdo, who said his wife and small daughter were cowering in their apartment with him, wrote on Twitter. \\u201cI can\\u2019t simply surrender and being captive. I am speaking out, and this is a crime. I might then ask death, and not got it. \\u201d Malek, an activist who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear that he would soon find himself in government territory, said he had moved on Monday to a safer place for the 10th time since the offensive began, along with his cats, Rocky and Loz, the Arabic word for almond. \\u201cWhy should I lie? I\\u2019m not well,\\u201d he said in a series of voice messages. \\u201cWe are people, are being deleted from the human map. We have two neighborhoods and one street, and the regime will keep bombing this small area. \\u201d Bodies were stuck under the rubble, Malek said, and even members of the White Helmets civil defense group could not rescue anyone, because the group\\u2019s equipment had been destroyed and their members scattered by the shelling. Still attempting to find humor, he said that his cat Rocky had lost \\u201chis fianc\\u00e9e\\u201d along the way. \\u201cNow he\\u2019s lonely,\\u201d Malek said. Dr. Salem, a dentist who had kept his clinic open until last week, finally moved to one of the last rebel neighborhoods as his own was taken by government forces. He said he walked through streets shrouded in smoke, and littered with the dead and wounded, to a small area where thousands were crowded in a shrinking space. \\u201cThere will be a massacre if one rocket falls here,\\u201d said Dr. Salem, using only his first name.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The measure, which passed by a vote of 172 to 40, opens the way for a challenge to Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s leadership. It technically changes nothing, as Mr. Corbyn has refused to step down, though it underscores his loss of authority among colleagues in Parliament. \\u201cI was democratically elected leader of our party for a new kind of politics by 60 percent of Labour members and supporters, and I will not betray them by resigning,\\u201d Mr. Corbyn said after the vote by Labour members of Parliament. \\u201cToday\\u2019s vote by M. P. s has no constitutional legitimacy. \\u201d He added: \\u201cWe are a democratic party with a clear constitution. Our people need Labour Party members, trade unionists and M. P. s to unite behind my leadership at a critical time for our country. \\u201d In the aftermath of Britain\\u2019s vote to leave the European Union, Mr. Corbyn has been hit by the mass resignation of most of his leadership team. About   of Parliament members opposed leaving the union, including the overwhelming majority of Labour members and a smaller majority of members from the governing Conservative Party. Prime Minister David Cameron announced on Friday, the day after the referendum, that he would resign, and a power struggle has begun within the Conservative Party over who will succeed him. Given the disarray in British politics, many Labour lawmakers are worried that a general election may be held soon, and they fear that, with Mr. Corbyn at the party\\u2019s helm, they will face even bigger losses than they did in the May 2015 election. A   Mr. Corbyn was elected last year by an overwhelming majority of party members and supporters, but his support was very shallow among lawmakers. Discontent at Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s performance was crystallized by his campaign in the referendum on European Union membership, in which the party\\u2019s policy was to remain within the bloc. While Mr. Corbyn, a lifelong euroskeptic, did urge Labour supporters to vote to remain, critics regarded his campaign as lackluster, and his message as lukewarm. Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s staunch ally John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor of the Exchequer and the party\\u2019s top spokesman on economic issues, has said that Mr. Corbyn is \\u201cnot going anywhere,\\u201d and even vowed to run Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s campaign if there were a new election among Labour Party members. Supporters of Mr. Corbyn have called on his critics to either shut up or challenge him in a formal leadership contest. Under the Labour Party system, the final choice lies with party members and supporters, and Mr. Corbyn\\u2019s allies, who include influential   activists, are confident that he would win   despite some indications that support for him is weakening.\",\n          \"Celebrities trashed President Donald Trump on social media Tuesday after his Education and Justice Departments announced that they would no longer instruct schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms according to their preferred gender identities.

Advances by Syrian government forces and their allies have squeezed the fighters and civilians remaining in   parts of the city into a sliver of territory, spokesmen for the government and the opposition forces said on Monday. The last civilians caught in the shrinking antigovernment enclave issued panicked calls for help. Late Monday, several residents reported via text and voice messages that they were crowded into abandoned apartments and rainy streets, exposed to shelling and afraid they would be killed or arrested if   forces reached them, as antigovernment activists circulated reports of scores of summary killings in retaken areas. The United Nations secretary general, Ban   said in a statement on Monday that he was alarmed by reports of atrocities against a large number of civilians, including women and children. It appeared increasingly likely that the government would gain control of the whole of Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, within days, if not hours. Videos from   districts showed people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and honking horns. That would be a turning point in the civil war, cementing government control over all of Syria\\u2019s most important cities and forcing the opposition and its backers to reckon with whether their movement, especially the armed rebellion, has failed. It also raises questions about how an increasingly confident President Bashar   will govern a deeply wounded and divided country where war still rages. Mr. Assad\\u2019s recent military successes have depended heavily on help from Russia, Iran and the   Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah, which are reviled by many of Mr. Assad\\u2019s Sunni opponents, and viewed with unease even by some of his supporters because of their growing power in the country. Large areas of Aleppo and other cities and towns have been reduced to rubble by the fighting. And rebel forces, Kurdish militias and Islamic State fighters are still operating in large areas of northern and eastern Syria. That has been vividly clear in recent days, with Islamic State fighters advancing in the desert city of Palmyra, amid its ancient ruins, as the government focused on Aleppo. For civilians trapped behind the battle lines in Aleppo, though, more urgent questions loomed. Time appeared to be running out to strike a deal to allow them to evacuate. Rebel and opposition leaders want evacuees to be given an option to go to territory they control. Many of the remaining civilians refuse to go to   territory because they are afraid they would be jailed and tortured there. Others say the bombardment in their districts is too intense to allow any escape. There were also reports in state news media of rebel shelling of   areas. According to the Russian government, Mr. Assad\\u2019s main foreign backer, more than 100, 000 people have fled from the rebel enclave to   areas, and 2, 200 rebel fighters have surrendered. At least 13, 000 people have fled in the past 24 hours, it said. But there are still believed to be thousands of civilians trapped in districts that have been bombarded for more than 24 hours, while the army and its militia allies seized most of the southern part of the city. \\u201cAn important call in the name of civilians to help them,\\u201d Abdelkafi   a teacher and antigovernment activist, said in a text message to a group of journalists. \\u201cStop bombing. Take them out. \\u201d The situation was so desperate, residents said, that it was unclear whether rebels and civilians there could even hold a meeting to decide whether to surrender and evacuate. \\u201cBelieve me, no one rejects the safety evacuation,\\u201d one resident, Yasser Abu   said in a text message to the journalists\\u2019 group. \\u201cAll of us are waiting, dying now in the last neighborhoods. \\u201d Hisham   is a civilian member of the local council that had tried to govern the   areas of Aleppo, which once included half the city. Mr. Skeif expressed frustration that while international officials were in contact with rebel leaders, no one appeared to be talking directly to the trapped civilians. \\u201cAll the political activists and the media, the relief workers, the unarmed, we are about 1, 000, including our families,\\u201d he said. Though the government has said it would offer amnesty to anyone who surrenders, \\u201cif the regime entered, we will be slaughtered,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOf course everybody is negotiating with those who are armed, but we are not armed. \\u201d \\u201cThe armed can defend themselves, but we can\\u2019t,\\u201d he added. Mr. Hamdo said in a series of text messages that families in Aleppo were \\u201cwaiting death together. \\u201d \\u201cPeople are running, don\\u2019t know where,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cPeople are under the rubble alive, and no one can save them. Some people are injured in the streets, and no one can go to help them cuz the bombs are always on the same place. \\u201d Some rebel leaders have said that the United States, which backs some rebel groups, sent them a proposal that would allow evacuees their choice of destination, under security guarantees from Russia. But trust has eroded, and no agreement had emerged by Monday night. Syrian and Russian officials say the offensive in Aleppo will continue until rebels surrender or die. \\u201cThe issue of withdrawing militants is the subject of separate agreements,\\u201d Sergei Ryabkov, the Russian deputy foreign minister, told the Ria news agency on Monday. \\u201cThis agreement has not yet been reached, largely because the United States insists on unacceptable terms. \\u201d The sticking point for months has been a dispute between Russia and the United States over what to do about fighters linked with Al Qaeda who are among the rebel groups in eastern Aleppo. The United Nations estimates that about 10 percent of the 8, 000 rebel fighters in the city belong to a   group, the Levant Conquest Front. The rebels and their international backers say the figure is much lower the government says it is much higher. Before the government broke through the rebel defenses, the United Nations was proposing that the Levant Conquest Front leave Aleppo in exchange for three main broad concessions from the government side: an end to bombardment protection and aid for remaining civilians and some form of local administration for rebel areas. But the government rejected any form of   saying that it would \\u201creward terrorists,\\u201d while the rebels rejected versions of the deal that did not include it. Now, there is no meaningful rebel territory left for the local opposition council to govern. \\u201cWe are hearing terrifying S O S calls from the civilians, but we can\\u2019t do anything,\\u201d said Bassem   a spokesman for Nour     one of the main rebel groups in Aleppo. \\u201cThe fighters are defending, but they are retreating under pressure. Unfortunately, the situation is very bad. \\u201d The focus has now shifted to ending the bombardment and protecting the remaining civilians from reprisals, a reasonable fear in a country where, throughout the   conflict, people have been tortured and killed in prison for opposing the government. \\u201cUnderstand this,\\u201d Mr. Hamdo, who said his wife and small daughter were cowering in their apartment with him, wrote on Twitter. \\u201cI can\\u2019t simply surrender and being captive. I am speaking out, and this is a crime. I might then ask death, and not got it. \\u201d Malek, an activist who asked to be identified only by his first name for fear that he would soon find himself in government territory, said he had moved on Monday to a safer place for the 10th time since the offensive began, along with his cats, Rocky and Loz, the Arabic word for almond. \\u201cWhy should I lie? I\\u2019m not well,\\u201d he said in a series of voice messages. \\u201cWe are people, are being deleted from the human map. We have two neighborhoods and one street, and the regime will keep bombing this small area. \\u201d Bodies were stuck under the rubble, Malek said, and even members of the White Helmets civil defense group could not rescue anyone, because the group\\u2019s equipment had been destroyed and their members scattered by the shelling.
